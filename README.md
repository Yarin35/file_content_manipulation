# file_content_manipulation
a few simple exercices with file content manipulation

❗Setup:
- npm i to install dependencies
- node file.js (choose the file.js that you wanna test)


dup_file.js: it duplicates a files and creates two new files (file_one.txt and file_two.txt)

change_content.js: it takes a file and changes all the ocurrence of the letter a by the letter e before writing it in a new file (output.txt)

word_counter.js: counts the number of words in a given file

word_search.js: counts the number of occurrence of a given word in a given file

❗❗❗ most of thoses need an input file so i recommend to create a input.txt and write some words in it 😉.
